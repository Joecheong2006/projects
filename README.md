# Personal Projects

This folder contains a collection of personal projects exploring compilers, graphics, simulations, algorithms, and various utilities. Each directory represents an independent project, experiment, or tool.

## Project Overview

### **cscript-v0.2**
A custom compiler written in C for a small experimental scripting language (“cscript”).

Features include:
- Lexer and parser
- AST construction
- Early-stage interpreter or code generation
- Focus on simplicity, modularity, and language experimentation

This is the most substantial project in the repository and reflects ongoing work in compiler design.

### **algorithms_visualizer**
A tool for visualizing classic algorithms such as sorting, searching, and graph traversal.

### **balls-collision**
A 2D physics simulation of colliding balls using vector math and elastic collision equations.

### **chess**
A simple chess implementation featuring board logic, move validation, and possibly a basic engine or UI.

### **cml**
An experiment with a custom markup or modeling language.

### **donut**
A terminal or graphical rendering of a rotating 3D torus (“ASCII donut”-style demo).

### **game_makerc**
A small game engine experiment written in C.

### **glsl-test**
A collection of GLSL shader experiments including ray tracing, lighting models, and mathematical visual effects.

### **json-parser**
A JSON parsing library written from scratch with tokenization and tree-building.

### **logger**
A lightweight logging library with log levels and formatted output.

### **mfw**
A personal mini-framework for windowing and graphics.

### **ml**
Machine learning experiments, including simple models and algorithm implementations.

### **pdf-parser**
A low-level project exploring PDF file structure and parsing PDF objects (ongoing).

### **rigid2d**
A 2D rigid-body physics simulation with integration and collision detection or balls, boxes, and many shapes.

### **schedule**
A CLI scheduling and task management tool.

### **typing**
A typing practice or typing game program.

### **UT**
Utility tools, testing code, and miscellaneous experiments.

### **plan.norg**
A personal notes or planning file written in the Norg format.

## Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A sandbox for experimentation
- An archive of long-term personal learning projects
- A portfolio showcasing systems programming, graphics, simulation, and language design work

Each project stands alone and may range from an early prototype to a complete tool.
