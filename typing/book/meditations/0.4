as an administrator he was prudent and conscientious. Although steeped 
in the teachings of philosophy, he did not attempt to remodel the world 
on any preconceived plan. He trod the path beaten by his predecessors, 
seeking only to do his duty as well as he could, and to keep out 
corruption. He did some unwise things, it is true. To create a compeer 
in empire, as he did with Verus, was a dangerous innovation which could 
only succeed if one of the two effaced himself; and under Diocletian 
this very precedent caused the Roman Empire to split into halves. He 
erred in his civil administration by too much centralising. But the 
strong point of his reign was the administration of justice. Marcus 
sought by-laws to protect the weak, to make the lot of the slaves 
less hard, to stand in place of father to the fatherless. Charitable 
foundations were endowed for rearing and educating poor children. The 
provinces were protected against oppression, and public help was given 
to cities or districts which might be visited by calamity. The great 
blot on his name, and one hard indeed to explain, is his treatment 
of the Christians. In his reign Justin at Rome became a martyr to 
his faith, and Polycarp at Smyrna, and we know of many outbreaks of 
fanaticism in the provinces which caused the death of the faithful. It 
is no excuse to plead that he knew nothing about the atrocities done in 
his name: it was his duty to know, and if he did not he would have been 
the first to confess that he had failed in his duty. But from his own 
tone in speaking of the Christians it is clear he knew them only from 
calumny; and we hear of no measures taken even to secure that they 
should have a fair hearing. In this respect Trajan was better than he. 
 
To a thoughtful mind such a religion as that of Rome would give small 
satisfaction. Its legends were often childish or impossible; its 
teaching had little to do with morality. The Roman religion was in fact 
of the nature of a bargain: men paid certain sacrifices and rites, and
