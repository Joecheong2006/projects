tyrants, in so large a measure to have their part of pleasures?' He who 
had all the world's pleasures at command can write thus 'A happy lot and 
portion is, good inclinations of the soul, good desires, good actions.' 
 
By the irony of fate this man, so gentle and good, so desirous of quiet 
joys and a mind free from care, was set at the head of the Roman Empire 
when great dangers threatened from east and west. For several years he 
himself commanded his armies in chief. In camp before the Quadi he dates 
the first book of his Meditations, and shows how he could retire within 
himself amid the coarse clangour of arms. The pomps and glories which 
he despised were all his; what to most men is an ambition or a dream, to 
him was a round of weary tasks which nothing but the stern sense of duty 
could carry him through. And he did his work well. His wars were slow 
and tedious, but successful. With a statesman's wisdom he foresaw the 
danger to Rome of the barbarian hordes from the north, and took measures 
to meet it. As it was, his settlement gave two centuries of respite 
to the Roman Empire; had he fulfilled the plan of pushing the imperial 
frontiers to the Elbe, which seems to have been in his mind, much more 
might have been accomplished. But death cut short his designs. 
 
Truly a rare opportunity was given to Marcus Aurelius of showing what 
the mind can do in despite of circumstances. Most peaceful of warriors, 
a magnificent monarch whose ideal was quiet happiness in home life, bent 
to obscurity yet born to greatness, the loving father of children who 
died young or turned out hateful, his life was one paradox. That nothing 
might lack, it was in camp before the face of the enemy that he passed 
away and went to his own place.
