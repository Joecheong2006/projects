'we must bear together, help together, comfort together.' But while 
he sees a chief importance in zeal, in exalted emotion that is, and 
avoidance of lukewarmness, the Roman thought mainly of the duty to be 
done as well as might be, and less of the feeling which should go with 
the doing of it. To the saint as to the emperor, the world is a poor 
thing at best. 'Verily it is a misery to live upon the earth,' says the 
Christian; few and evil are the days of man's life, which passeth away 
suddenly as a shadow. 
 
But there is one great difference between the two books we are 
considering. The Imitation is addressed to others, the Meditations 
by the writer to himself. We learn nothing from the Imitation of 
the author's own life, except in so far as he may be assumed to have 
practised his own preachings; the Meditations reflect mood by mood the 
mind of him who wrote them. In their intimacy and frankness lies their 
great charm. These notes are not sermons; they are not even confessions. 
There is always an air of self-consciousness in confessions; in such 
revelations there is always a danger of unctuousness or of vulgarity for 
the best of men. St. Augus-tine is not always clear of offence, and John 
Bunyan himself exaggerates venial peccadilloes into heinous sins. But 
Marcus Aurelius is neither vulgar nor unctuous; he extenuates nothing, 
but nothing sets down in malice. He never poses before an audience; he 
may not be profound, he is always sincere. And it is a lofty and serene 
soul which is here disclosed before us. Vulgar vices seem to have no 
temptation for him; this is not one tied and bound with chains which 
he strives to break. The faults he detects in himself are often such as 
most men would have no eyes to see. To serve the divine spirit which 
is implanted within him, a man must 'keep himself pure from all violent 
passion and evil affection, from all rashness and vanity, and from all 
manner of discontent, either in regard of the gods or men': or, as he
