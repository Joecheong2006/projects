This dictum might easily be taken to mean that virtue consists in 
yielding to each natural impulse; but that was very far from the Stoic 
meaning. In order to live in accord with nature, it is necessary to know 
what nature is; and to this end a threefold division of philosophy is 
made--into Physics, dealing with the universe and its laws, the problems 
of divine government and teleology; Logic, which trains the mind to 
discern true from false; and Ethics, which applies the knowledge thus 
gained and tested to practical life. The Stoic system of physics was 
materialism with an infusion of pantheism. In contradiction to Plato's 
view that the Ideas, or Prototypes, of phenomena alone really exist, 
the Stoics held that material objects alone existed; but immanent in 
the material universe was a spiritual force which acted through them, 
manifesting itself under many forms, as fire, aether, spirit, soul, 
reason, the ruling principle. 
 
The universe, then, is God, of whom the popular gods are manifestations; 
while legends and myths are allegorical. The soul of man is thus an 
emanation from the godhead, into whom it will eventually be re-absorbed. 
The divine ruling principle makes all things work together for good, 
but for the good of the whole. The highest good of man is consciously 
to work with God for the common good, and this is the sense in which 
the Stoic tried to live in accord with nature. In the individual it 
is virtue alone which enables him to do this; as Providence rules the 
universe, so virtue in the soul must rule man. 
 
In Logic, the Stoic system is noteworthy for their theory as to the test 
of truth, the Criterion. They compared the new-born soul to a sheet of 
paper ready for writing. Upon this the senses write their impressions, 
fantasias and by experience of a number of these the soul unconsciously 
conceives general notions koinai eunoiai or anticipations. prolhyeis
