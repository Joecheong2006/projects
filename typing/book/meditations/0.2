but thus much is certain, that in the end the Romans succeeded in 
crushing the barbarian tribes, and effecting a settlement which made the 
empire more secure. Marcus was himself commander-in-chief, and victory 
was due no less to his own ability than to his wisdom in choice of 
lieutenants, shown conspicuously in the case of Pertinax. There were 
several important battles fought in these campaigns; and one of them has 
become celebrated for the legend of the Thundering Legion. In a battle 
against the Quadi in 174, the day seemed to be going in favour of 
the foe, when on a sudden arose a great storm of thunder and rain the 
lightning struck the barbarians with terror, and they turned to rout. 
In later days this storm was said to have been sent in answer to the 
prayers of a legion which contained many Christians, and the name 
Thundering Legion should be given to it on this account. The title of 
Thundering Legion is known at an earlier date, so this part of the story 
at least cannot be true; but the aid of the storm is acknowledged by one 
of the scenes carved on Antonine's Column at Rome, which commemorates 
these wars. 
 
The settlement made after these troubles might have been more 
satisfactory but for an unexpected rising in the east. Avidius Cassius, 
an able captain who had won renown in the Parthian wars, was at this 
time chief governor of the eastern provinces. By whatever means induced, 
he had conceived the project of proclaiming himself emperor as soon as 
Marcus, who was then in feeble health, should die; and a report having 
been conveyed to him that Marcus was dead, Cassius did as he had 
planned. Marcus, on hearing the news, immediately patched up a peace and 
returned home to meet this new peril. The emperors great grief was that 
he must needs engage in the horrors of civil strife. He praised the 
qualities of Cassius, and expressed a heartfelt wish that Cassius might 
not be driven to do himself a hurt before he should have the opportunity
