universe is guided and governed by divine Providence. This is a special 
application of the favourite Greek virtue of moderation, (swfrosuum) and 
has also its parallel in Christian ethics. The second point is a strong 
insistence on the unity of the universe, and on man's duty as part of a 
great whole. Public spirit was the most splendid political virtue of the 
ancient world, and it is here made cosmopolitan. It is again instructive 
to note that Christian sages insisted on the same thing. Christians 
are taught that they are members of a worldwide brotherhood, where is 
neither Greek nor Hebrew, bond nor free and that they live their lives 
as fellow-workers with God. 
 
Such is the system which underlies the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius. 
Some knowledge of it is necessary to the right understanding of the 
book, but for us the chief interest lies elsewhere. We do not come to 
Marcus Aurelius for a treatise on Stoicism. He is no head of a school to 
lay down a body of doctrine for students; he does not even contemplate 
that others should read what he writes. His philosophy is not an eager 
intellectual inquiry, but more what we should call religious feeling. 
The uncompromising stiffness of Zeno or Chrysippus is softened and 
transformed by passing through a nature reverent and tolerant, gentle 
and free from guile; the grim resignation which made life possible to 
the Stoic sage becomes in him almost a mood of aspiration. His book 
records the innermost thoughts of his heart, set down to ease it, with 
such moral maxims and reflections as may help him to bear the burden of 
duty and the countless annoyances of a busy life. 
 
It is instructive to compare the Meditations with another famous book, 
the Imitation of Christ. There is the same ideal of self-control in 
both. It should be a man's task, says the Imitation, 'to overcome 
himself, and every day to be stronger than himself.' 'In withstanding of
