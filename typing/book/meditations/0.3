to grant a free pardon. But before he could come to the east news had 
come to Cassius that the emperor still lived; his followers fell away 
from him, and he was assassinated. Marcus now went to the east, and 
while there the murderers brought the head of Cassius to him; but the 
emperor indignantly refused their gift, nor would he admit the men to

lived--the weak and worthless Commodus. On his father's death Commodus, 
who succeeded him, undid the work of many campaigns by a hasty and
