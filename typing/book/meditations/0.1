partisans showed an eagerness in supporting them which nothing could 
surpass. Riot and corruption went in the train of the racing chariots; 
and from all these things Marcus held severely aloof. 
 
In 140 Marcus was raised to the consulship, and in 145 his betrothal 
was consummated by marriage. Two years later Faustina brought him a 
daughter; and soon after the tribunate and other imperial honours were 
conferred upon him. 
 
Antoninus Pius died in 161, and Marcus assumed the imperial state. He 
at once associated with himself L. Ceionius Commodus, whom Antoninus had 
adopted as a younger son at the same time with Marcus, giving him the 
name of Lucius Aurelius Verus. Henceforth the two are colleagues in the 
empire, the junior being trained as it were to succeed. No sooner was 
Marcus settled upon the throne than wars broke out on all sides. In 
the east, Vologeses III. of Parthia began a long-meditated revolt by 
destroying a whole Roman Legion and invading Syria (162). Verus was sent 
off in hot haste to quell this rising; and he fulfilled his trust by 
plunging into drunkenness and debauchery, while the war was left to his 
officers. Soon after Marcus had to face a more serious danger at home in 
the coalition of several powerful tribes on the northern frontier. Chief 
among those were the Marcomanni or Marchmen, the Quadi (mentioned in 
this book), the Sarmatians, the Catti, the Jazyges. In Rome itself there 
was pestilence and starvation, the one brought from the east by Verus's 
legions, the other caused by floods which had destroyed vast quantities 
of grain. After all had been done possible to allay famine and to supply 
pressing needs--Marcus being forced even to sell the imperial jewels to 
find money--both emperors set forth to a struggle which was to continue 
more or less during the rest of Marcus's reign. During these wars, in 
169, Verus died. We have no means of following the campaigns in detail;
