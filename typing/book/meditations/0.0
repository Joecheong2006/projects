INTRODUCTION 
 
MARCUS AURELIUS ANTONINUS was born on April 26, A.D. 121. His real name 
was M. Annius Verus, and he was sprung of a noble family which claimed 
descent from Numa, second King of Rome. Thus the most religious of 
emperors came of the blood of the most pious of early kings. His father, 
Annius Verus, had held high office in Rome, and his grandfather, of 
the same name, had been thrice Consul. Both his parents died young, but 
Marcus held them in loving remembrance. On his father's death Marcus 
was adopted by his grandfather, the consular Annius Verus, and there was 
deep love between these two. On the very first page of his book Marcus 
gratefully declares how of his grandfather he had learned to be gentle 
and meek, and to refrain from all anger and passion. The Emperor Hadrian 
divined the fine character of the lad, whom he used to call not Verus 
but Verissimus, more Truthful than his own name. He advanced Marcus to 
equestrian rank when six years of age, and at the age of eight made him 
a member of the ancient Salian priesthood. The boy's aunt, Annia Galeria 
Faustina, was married to Antoninus Pius, afterwards emperor. Hence it 
came about that Antoninus, having no son, adopted Marcus, changing his 
name to that which he is known by, and betrothed him to his daughter 
Faustina. His education was conducted with all care. The ablest teachers 
were engaged for him, and he was trained in the strict doctrine of the 
Stoic philosophy, which was his great delight. He was taught to dress 
plainly and to live simply, to avoid all softness and luxury. His body 
was trained to hardihood by wrestling, hunting, and outdoor games; and 
though his constitution was weak, he showed great personal courage to 
encounter the fiercest boars. At the same time he was kept from the 
extravagancies of his day. The great excitement in Rome was the strife 
of the Factions, as they were called, in the circus. The racing drivers 
used to adopt one of four colours--red, blue, white, or green--and their
