less empty and vain. 'Thou hast taken ship,' he says, 'thou hast sailed, 
thou art come to land, go out, if to another life, there also shalt 
thou find gods, who are everywhere.' There is more in this than the 
assumption of a rival theory for argument's sake. If worldly things 
'be but as a dream, the thought is not far off that there may be an 
awakening to what is real. When he speaks of death as a necessary

by them. To wait until the emergency is to be too late. He sees also the 
true essence of happiness. 'If happiness did consist in pleasure, 
how came notorious robbers, impure abominable livers, parricides, and
