the gods granted their favour, irrespective of right or wrong. In this 
case all devout souls were thrown back upon philosophy, as they had 
been, though to a less extent, in Greece. There were under the early 
empire two rival schools which practically divided the field between 
them, Stoicism and Epicureanism. The ideal set before each was nominally 
much the same. The Stoics aspired to the repression of all emotion, and 
the Epicureans to freedom from all disturbance; yet in the upshot the 
one has become a synonym of stubborn endurance, the other for unbridled 
licence. With Epicureanism we have nothing to do now; but it will be 
worth while to sketch the history and tenets of the Stoic sect. Zeno, 
the founder of Stoicism, was born in Cyprus at some date unknown, but 
his life may be said roughly to be between the years 350 and 250 B.C. 
Cyprus has been from time immemorial a meeting-place of the East and 
West, and although we cannot grant any importance to a possible strain 
of Phoenician blood in him (for the Phoenicians were no philosophers), 
yet it is quite likely that through Asia Minor he may have come in touch 
with the Far East. He studied under the cynic Crates, but he did not 
neglect other philosophical systems. After many years' study he opened 
his own school in a colonnade in Athens called the Painted Porch, or 
Stoa, which gave the Stoics their name. Next to Zeno, the School of the 
Porch owes most to Chrysippus (280--207 b.c.), who organised Stoicism 
into a system. Of him it was said, 'But for Chrysippus, there had been 
no Porch.' 
 
The Stoics regarded speculation as a means to an end and that end was, 
as Zeno put it, to live consistently omologonuenws zhn or as it was 
later explained, to live in conformity with nature. This conforming of 
the life to nature oralogoumenwz th fusei zhn. was the Stoic idea of 
Virtue.
