the passions standeth very peace of heart.' 'Let us set the axe to the 
root, that we being purged of our passions may have a peaceable mind.' 
To this end there must be continual self-examination. 'If thou may not 
continually gather thyself together, namely sometimes do it, at least 
once a day, the morning or the evening. In the morning purpose, in the 
evening discuss the manner, what thou hast been this day, in word, work, 
and thought.' But while the Roman's temper is a modest self-reliance, 
the Christian aims at a more passive mood, humbleness and meekness, 
and reliance on the presence and personal friendship of God. The Roman 
scrutinises his faults with severity, but without the self-contempt 
which makes the Christian 'vile in his own sight.' The Christian, like 
the Roman, bids 'study to withdraw thine heart from the love of things 
visible'; but it is not the busy life of duty he has in mind so much as 
the contempt of all worldly things, and the 'cutting away of all 
lower delectations.' Both rate men's praise or blame at their real 
worthlessness; 'Let not thy peace,' says the Christian, 'be in the 
mouths of men.' But it is to God's censure the Christian appeals, the 
Roman to his own soul. The petty annoyances of injustice or unkindness 
are looked on by each with the same magnanimity. 'Why doth a little 
thing said or done against thee make thee sorry? It is no new thing; it 
is not the first, nor shall it be the last, if thou live long. At best 
suffer patiently, if thou canst not suffer joyously.' The Christian 
should sorrow more for other men's malice than for our own wrongs; but 
the Roman is inclined to wash his hands of the offender. 'Study to be 
patient in suffering and bearing other men's defaults and all manner 
infirmities,' says the Christian; but the Roman would never have thought 
to add, 'If all men were perfect, what had we then to suffer of other 
men for God?' The virtue of suffering in itself is an idea which does 
not meet us in the Meditations. Both alike realise that man is one of a 
great community. 'No man is sufficient to himself,' says the Christian;
