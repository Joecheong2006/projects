is the more wonderful in that he lacked the faith which makes Christians 
strong. He could say, it is true, 'either there is a God, and then all 
is well; or if all things go by chance and fortune, yet mayest thou use 
thine own providence in those things that concern thee properly; and 
then art thou well.' Or again, 'We must needs grant that there is a 
nature that doth govern the universe.' But his own part in the scheme 
of things is so small, that he does not hope for any personal happiness 
beyond what a serene soul may win in this mortal life. 'O my soul, the 
time I trust will be, when thou shalt be good, simple, more open and 
visible, than that body by which it is enclosed;' but this is said of 
the calm contentment with human lot which he hopes to attain, not of a 
time when the trammels of the body shall be cast off. For the rest, the 
world and its fame and wealth, 'all is vanity.' The gods may perhaps 
have a particular care for him, but their especial care is for the 
universe at large: thus much should suffice. His gods are better than 
the Stoic gods, who sit aloof from all human things, untroubled and 
uncaring, but his personal hope is hardly stronger. On this point he 
says little, though there are many allusions to death as the natural 
end; doubtless he expected his soul one day to be absorbed into the 
universal soul, since nothing comes out of nothing, and nothing can be 
annihilated. His mood is one of strenuous weariness; he does his duty as 
a good soldier, waiting for the sound of the trumpet which shall sound 
the retreat; he has not that cheerful confidence which led Socrates 
through a life no less noble, to a death which was to bring him into the 
company of gods he had worshipped and men whom he had revered. 
 
But although Marcus Aurelius may have held intellectually that his soul 
was destined to be absorbed, and to lose consciousness of itself, there 
were times when he felt, as all who hold it must sometimes feel, how 
unsatisfying is such a creed. Then he gropes blindly after something
