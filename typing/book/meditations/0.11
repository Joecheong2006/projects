says elsewhere, 'unspotted by pleasure, undaunted by pain.' Unwavering 
courtesy and consideration are his aims. 'Whatsoever any man either 
doth or saith, thou must be good;' 'doth any man offend? It is against

There are so many hints of offence forgiven, that we may believe the 
notes followed sharp on the facts. Perhaps he has fallen short of his

pages are full of generous gratitude to those who had served him. In his

to have given him something good, a sure proof of the goodness of his 
nature, which thought no evil. 
 
If his was that honest and true heart which is the Christian ideal, this
